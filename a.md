### Design without principle

Agroecology is more than diagnosing problems with conventional agriculture and generating alternatives. Agropunk sidesteps the problem-solving imperative (leaving it to trained experts), and isolates **worldbuilding** (the spectral fourth arm of agroecology) as an end in itself. Here is space to imagine farming and food systems on other Earth's, other worlds, free from economic, anthropocentric, and thermodynamic realities.

### Wherefore agropunk?


Agropunk is indigenous to abstract space. Agropunk is an encounter between (human and nonhuman) food producers, the lifeworld-as-it-might-have-been, and the fleshy Earth in all her immediacy. Agropunk dreams of anarchy but plays games of inside-outside in the capitalist wastelands. Agropunk greets the means, medians and modes of production as fellow persons. Agropunk is a harvest ritual to invoke the critical and material consequences of imagination. Agropunk finds perverse pleasure in the patterns of monoculture even as it moves to subvert them. Agropunk is a symbiotic fungus at the margins of a cornfield, suppressing its pathogenic urges.
